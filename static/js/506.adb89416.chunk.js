A team of master chefs, passionately eager to share their knowledge through exciting culinary masterclasses, decided to create a website-application to provide everyone interested with an impeccable experience, where people can explore the world of delicious recipes and step-by-step video tutorials. This web application is a team project, with a development period of 7 days. TastyTreats is a two-page website-application that contains several sections. They help the user easily and conveniently make a choice and order delicious recipes with step-by-step video guidance on their preparation. On the main page of the website, there is an option to choose the site theme: light or dark colors and a convenient order basket. In the \'ALL CATEGORIES\' section, users have the opportunity to choose dishes and ingredients. By selecting specific ingredients, the site will provide the user with dishes that include these ingredients. The \'Gallery\' section has a convenient filter and search function, allowing users to find specific dishes, as well as apply filters by cooking time, country of origin, and ingredients. In addition, photos of dishes are provided along with their rating among users. Also, in the \'Gallery\' section, there is an option to click on the photo of any dish, which will open a window where a video with instructions for preparing this dish will be available. The necessary ingredients and their proportions, along with a description of the cooking process for the dish, will also be provided. Plus, the cooking time and rating are indicated. After visiting the \'Gallery\', choosing a dish, and watching the instructional video, users have the opportunity to write a review of the dish and rate it. And this option is available in a convenient modal window. The \'POPULAR RECIPES\' section displays photos, names, and descriptions of the most popular dishes. On the second page, titled \'FAVORITES\', users can see the dishes they marked as interesting in the \'Gallery\' section. Also, on this page, there is a convenient filter that allows users to find dishes by categories. Plus, if a dish is no longer of interest to the user, it can be easily removed from this section.","technical_task":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kRAq5bP7X4DqQ-ORzrWMvcqrqwqlXRTe5dba0VHEkK4/edit?usp=sharing","technologies":[{"name":"HTML5","link":"https://html.spec.whatwg.org"},{"name":"CSS3","link":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS"},{"name":"JavaScript","link":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript"},{"name":"Visual Studio","link":"https://code.visualstudio.com"},{"name":"Handlebars","link":"https://handlebarsjs.com"},{"name":"SASS / SCSS","link":"https://sass-lang.com"},{"name":"Axios","link":"https://axios-http.com/docs/api_intro"},{"name":"Git","link":"https://git-scm.com"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com"},{"name":"Postman","link":"https://www.postman.com"}],"libraries":[{"name":"Parcel","link":"https://parceljs.org"},{"name":"Modern Normalizer","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/modern-normalize"},{"name":"Notiflix","link":"https://notiflix.github.io/notify"},{"name":"Swiper","link":"https://swiperjs.com"},{"name":"Tui Pagination","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/tui-pagination"},{"name":"jSDelivr (body-scroll-lock)","link":"https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/body-scroll-lock"},{"name":"cdnjs (animate.min.css)","link":"https://cdnjs.com/libraries/animate.css"},{"name":"lodash.debounce","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.debounce"},{"name":"Tasty Treats API(as backend)","link":"https://tasty-treats-backend.p.goit.global/api-docs/"}]},{"id":"R_kgDOKGJh7w","name":"Ruh","role":"Developer","coverImage":"https://i.imgur.com/PbqGDpH.jpg","img_url":[{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/kn5pSta.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/NAH7cBn.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/QcIyyPS.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/Vjl6GlU.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/gBs9fxh.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/PbqGDpH.jpg"}],"figma_url":"https://www.figma.com/file/lIqGEEOrEBBk5otVi1NG64/%7C-R-O-O-H-%7C-(Copy)-(Copy)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=3GjejMOtxEJxewxC-0","description":"Ruh is a 3-page web application with responsive design implemented using HTML, CSS, and JS.

The entire project, specifically both the Front-End and Back-End, was built from scratch based on the technical specifications and a Figma design. HEALTH_EN is an 8-page application with responsive design, fully compliant with all modern requirements. This site is designed for those who want to normalize their nutrition, monitor their daily calorie intake needed to maintain their current body mass, or according to the selected mode. This application cannot be used without a personal account. To start, the user will need to go through 5 stages of registration and enter their data such as email, password, username, height, weight, age, the diet mode the user will use, choice of gender, and the user\'s activity level. All this is necessary to provide the user with as accurate information as possible for calculations. In case the user forgets the password, they can easily change it even before logging in. To do this, they just need to go to the \'Forgot Your Password\' page and enter their email. They will receive an email with a temporary password allowing them to log into the system. This temporary password can be easily changed on the \'Settings\' page, along with any other data previously entered by the user. Also on the \'Settings\' page, the user can change their avatar if desired. With daily use of this application, updating their current weight is a mandatory part. This should be the first action of the user when logging into the system for the first time each day. On the \'Recommended Food\' page, there is a list of recommended products, taking into account their caloric content. The \'Dashboard\' page represents a summary statistics of weight changes, the amount of water consumed, and food intake over the selected period. On the main page, the user can enter and edit the amount of water consumed per day, as well as see the necessary limits of its consumption. The same applies to food. The user is provided with the opportunity to see the required calories, fats, carbohydrates, and how much they have already consumed and how much is left. Convenient graphs help with this. On the \'Diary\' page, the user can see all their food intakes throughout the day and also manage them independently. They can fill them in, edit, or even delete them.","technical_task":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ue6Gk9E-Wt4ZfzEn7RdqajlrdLgEXoM/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106322449708075322597&rtpof=true&sd=true","technologies":[{"name":"HTML5","link":"https://html.spec.whatwg.org"},{"name":"JavaScript","link":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript"},{"name":"React","link":"https://react.dev"},{"name":"Redux","link":"https://redux.js.org"},{"name":"Styled Components","link":"https://styled-components.com"},{"name":"Axios","link":"https://axios-http.com/docs/api_intro"},{"name":"Visual Studio","link":"https://code.visualstudio.com"},{"name":"Git","link":"https://git-scm.com"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com"},{"name":"Postman","link":"https://www.postman.com"},{"name":"MongoDB","link":"https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=search_gs_pl_evergreen_atlas_core_prosp-brand_gic-null_emea-ua_ps-all_desktop_eng_lead&utm_term=mongodb&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624575&adgroup=115749710823&cq_cmp=12212624575&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA_OetBhAtEiwAPTeQZy-VKImwt1qJHg8yNCl4a_hX5XmBxUh821Oa4HKoboH2OUpctL_ewhoCh7kQAvD_BwE"},{"name":"Node.js","link":"https://nodejs.org/en"},{"name":"HEALTH_EN_BACKEND","link":"https://github.com/Sheremeta-Ivan/HEALTH_EN_BACKEND"}],"libraries":[{"name":"React","link":"https://react.dev"},{"name":"Redux","link":"https://redux.js.org"},{"name":"React Spinners","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners"},{"name":"React Toastify","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify"},{"name":"Eslint Plugin Import","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import"},{"name":"Modern Normalize","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/modern-normalize"},{"name":"Normalize.css","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/normalize.css?activeTab=versions"},{"name":"NanoId","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid"},{"name":"Formik","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik"},{"name":"Yup","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup"},{"name":"React Charts 2","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2"},{"name":"HEALTH_EN API(swagger)","link":"https://healthy-hub-backend-fs5j.onrender.com/api-docs/"}]},{"id":"R_kgDOK_6p1w","name":"HealthyHub","role":"Developer","coverImage":"https://i.imgur.com/HwKGlqr.jpg","img_url":[{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/ACSsviu.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/H1oJZFN.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/lXyIewE.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/ggtghpK.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/3DRo504.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/UP6jJ4h.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/1aJeRRQ.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/JcBO7qF.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/NYyLTwM.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/Rb2NiBT.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/r4FNqp4.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/MI2C4ck.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/HwKGlqr.jpg"}],"figma_url":"https://www.figma.com/file/TY1tlWppyNqqV3HDMs2hWX/HealthyHub?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=DjHVg3QtQV3TBpVF-0","description":"HealthyHub is an enhanced version of the team project HEALTH_EN. This web application has exactly the same functionality, layout, and Back-End as HEALTH_EN. It has the same technical implementation. The difference lies in the improved functionality, bug fixes, and the addition of custom animations. Here, shortcomings in the operation of dropdowns were addressed, with the logic of their operation completely rewritten. Issues and errors on the \'Settings\' page in handling requests to change user data and change user avatar were resolved. A preview of the new avatar when changing it has been added. Custom animations have been added on the main page. Redirect flaws on pages have been fixed (now when the user reloads the page, they remain on it instead of being redirected to the main page). Styling issues, particularly with scrollbars, have been resolved.","technical_task":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ue6Gk9E-Wt4ZfzEn7RdqajlrdLgEXoM/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106322449708075322597&rtpof=true&sd=true","technologies":[{"name":"HTML5","link":"https://html.spec.whatwg.org"},{"name":"JavaScript","link":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript"},{"name":"React","link":"https://react.dev"},{"name":"Redux","link":"https://redux.js.org"},{"name":"Styled Components","link":"https://styled-components.com"},{"name":"Axios","link":"https://axios-http.com/docs/api_intro"},{"name":"Visual Studio","link":"https://code.visualstudio.com"},{"name":"Git","link":"https://git-scm.com"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com"},{"name":"Postman","link":"https://www.postman.com"},{"name":"MongoDB","link":"https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=search_gs_pl_evergreen_atlas_core_prosp-brand_gic-null_emea-ua_ps-all_desktop_eng_lead&utm_term=mongodb&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624575&adgroup=115749710823&cq_cmp=12212624575&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA_OetBhAtEiwAPTeQZy-VKImwt1qJHg8yNCl4a_hX5XmBxUh821Oa4HKoboH2OUpctL_ewhoCh7kQAvD_BwE"},{"name":"Node.js","link":"https://nodejs.org/en"},{"name":"HEALTH_EN_BACKEND","link":"https://github.com/Sheremeta-Ivan/HEALTH_EN_BACKEND"}],"libraries":[{"name":"React","link":"https://react.dev"},{"name":"Redux","link":"https://redux.js.org"},{"name":"React Spinners","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners"},{"name":"React Toastify","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify"},{"name":"Eslint Plugin Import","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import"},{"name":"Modern Normalize","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/modern-normalize"},{"name":"Normalize.css","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/normalize.css?activeTab=versions"},{"name":"NanoId","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid"},{"name":"Formik","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik"},{"name":"Yup","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup"},{"name":"React Charts 2","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2"},{"name":"HEALTH_EN API(swagger)","link":"https://healthy-hub-backend-fs5j.onrender.com/api-docs/"}]},{"id":"R_kgDOLG9kRA","name":"CV_WebSite","role":"Developer","coverImage":"https://i.imgur.com/YsbOt42.jpg","img_url":[{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/m5Rkpk2.png"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/YsbOt42.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/dBu2OU2.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/CTGCKYu.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/YPv9yKZ.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/HOE7VaU.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/nRPvSFS.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/KG2Ygne.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.imgur.com/qWlTjD5.jpg"}],"figma_url":null,"description":"CV_WebSite is a 6-page web application created as a developer portfolio website. It can serve as both a primary and supplementary tool for your resume. The site is fully responsive and meets all modern requirements for such development, looking equally good on all types of devices. The application was built using the REACT/REDUX library with full imitation of server-side functionality. All data displayed in the application is stored in three JSON files (simulating data retrieval from a backend) and can be easily modified or tailored to another user. In case of a deployed backend or if needed, this application can be easily connected to it, thanks to the pre-configured REDUX state management library. Each page of this site is self-contained and contains all the necessary information about the developer. Upon entering the site, you are greeted with the \'Home\' page, featuring the developer\'s name, a brief description, and the ability to view their resume. The \'About\' page contains more detailed information about the developer, including GitHub statistics. This page also features subtle, non-intrusive animation, giving it a livelier appearance. On the \'Education\' page, you can find information about the developer\'s education and the institutions they attended. Animated sliders are present on this page, giving it a more atmospheric look. All photos can be viewed in a separate window by simply clicking on the button on the photo itself. The \'Skills\' page contains information about the developer\'s professional skills, as well as official GitHub statistics for all repositories and programming languages. The \'Portfolio\' page is a collection of all the developer\'s projects. To get information about a particular project, simply hover over the project of interest and open it. This will open a separate window where you can find all the detailed information about the project. The \'Contact\' page allows you to contact the developer directly.","technical_task":null,"technologies":[{"name":"HTML5","link":"https://html.spec.whatwg.org"},{"name":"JavaScript","link":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript"},{"name":"React","link":"https://react.dev"},{"name":"Redux","link":"https://redux.js.org"},{"name":"Styled Components","link":"https://styled-components.com"},{"name":"Visual Studio","link":"https://code.visualstudio.com"},{"name":"Git","link":"https://git-scm.com"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com"}],"libraries":[{"name":"React","link":"https://react.dev"},{"name":"Redux","link":"https://redux.js.org"},{"name":"React Spinners","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners"},{"name":"Eslint Plugin Import","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import"},{"name":"Modern Normalize","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/modern-normalize"},{"name":"Normalize.css","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/normalize.css?activeTab=versions"},{"name":"NanoId","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid"},{"name":"React Charts 2","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2"},{"name":"Anime.js","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/animejs"},{"name":"React GitHub Calendar","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-github-calendar"},{"name":"React Intersection Observer","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer"},{"name":"React Tooltip","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tooltip"},{"name":"Typewriter Effect","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/typewriter-effect"},{"name":"Swiper","link":"https://swiperjs.com"},{"name":"Formik","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik"},{"name":"Yup","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup"},{"name":"EmailJS","link":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emailjs/browser"}]}]');var v=n(8982);const j=()=>{const e=(0,w.I0)(),{isPortfolioRefactoredData:t,isPortfolioData:n}=(0,g.e)(),{data:{repositoryOwner:{repositories:{nodes:i}}}}=b,s=i.map((e=>{let{id:t,type:n,url:i,homepageUrl:a,createdAt:o,collaborators:{nodes:s},languages:{edges:r}}=e;return{id:t,type:n,url:i,homepageUrl:a,createdAt:o,collaborators:s.map((e=>{let{name:t,url:n}=e;return{name:t,url:n}})),languages:r.map((e=>{let{size:t,node:{name:n}}=e;return{name:n,size:t}}))}})),r=s.filter((e=>"individual"===e.type||"team"===e.type)),l=(0,m.useMemo)((()=>{const e=[];return r.forEach((t=>{const n=y.find((e=>e.id===t.id));if(n){const i={id:t.id,type:t.type,url:t.url,homepageUrl:t.homepageUrl,createdAt:t.createdAt,collaborators:t.collaborators,languages:t.languages,name:n.name,role:n.role,coverImage:n.coverImage,figma_url:n.figma_url,img_url:n.img_url,description:n.description,technical_task:n.technical_task,technologies:n.technologies,libraries:n.libraries};e.push(i)}})),e}),[r]);return(0,m.useEffect)((()=>{n||e((0,v.Ip)(l)),t||e((0,v.xd)(r))}),[e,r,n,t,l]),(0,f.jsx)(a.$,{children:(0,f.jsx)(o.W,{children:(0,f.jsx)(k,{})})})}}}]);
