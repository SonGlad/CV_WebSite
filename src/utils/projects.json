To do this, simply enter the image name in the input field and perform the search. When the search based on your query is successfully completed, along with the images, a notification will be displayed indicating how many images were found based on your query. In case nothing is found for your query, a notification will also be displayed. The initial query includes 40 images. If more images are found based on the search, the remaining images can be viewed by clicking the 'Load More' button at the bottom of the screen. For each of your queries, a notification will also be displayed indicating how many images have been viewed and how many are left. All notifications are connected using the 'Notiflix' library. Clicking on any image will open a modal window with an embedded slider, allowing you to view the images in their original size and scroll through them without leaving the window. The modal window and slider are implemented using the 'Simple Lightbox' library.",

A team of master chefs, passionately eager to share their knowledge through exciting culinary masterclasses, decided to create a website-application to provide everyone interested with an impeccable experience, where people can explore the world of delicious recipes and step-by-step video tutorials. This web application is a team project, with a development period of 7 days. TastyTreats is a two-page website-application that contains several sections. They help the user easily and conveniently make a choice and order delicious recipes with step-by-step video guidance on their preparation. On the main page of the website, there is an option to choose the site theme: light or dark colors and a convenient order basket. In the 'ALL CATEGORIES' section, users have the opportunity to choose dishes and ingredients. By selecting specific ingredients, the site will provide the user with dishes that include these ingredients. The 'Gallery' section has a convenient filter and search function, allowing users to find specific dishes, as well as apply filters by cooking time, country of origin, and ingredients. In addition, photos of dishes are provided along with their rating among users. Also, in the 'Gallery' section, there is an option to click on the photo of any dish, which will open a window where a video with instructions for preparing this dish will be available. The necessary ingredients and their proportions, along with a description of the cooking process for the dish, will also be provided. Plus, the cooking time and rating are indicated. After visiting the 'Gallery', choosing a dish, and watching the instructional video, users have the opportunity to write a review of the dish and rate it. And this option is available in a convenient modal window. The 'POPULAR RECIPES' section displays photos, names, and descriptions of the most popular dishes. On the second page, titled 'FAVORITES', users can see the dishes they marked as interesting in the 'Gallery' section. Also, on this page, there is a convenient filter that allows users to find dishes by categories. Plus, if a dish is no longer of interest to the user, it can be easily removed from this section.",

        "description": "Image Finder is a single-page, responsive web application created entirely using the React library. It allows users to easily search for any images using the Pixabay API database. To perform a search, users simply need to enter the image name in the input field and initiate the search. When the search is successfully completed based on the user's query, a notification will be displayed along with the images. In case nothing is found based on the user's query, a notification will also be displayed. The initial query includes 12 images. If more images are found based on the search, the remaining images can be viewed by clicking the 'Load More' button at the bottom of the screen. All notifications are connected using the 'React Toastify' library. When clicking on any image, a modal window will open, allowing users to view the images in their original size. During low internet speeds, users can observe a Loader while waiting, which is connected using the 'React Spinners' library.",

        "description": "Phonebook is a responsive web application consisting of five pages, built using the REACT/REDUX libraries. Initially, it started as an educational project, but thanks to the idea of creating something more than just a learning exercise, it evolved into a fully-fledged, stylized application. Unfortunately, it is only adapted for tablet and desktop devices. The application requires users to be registered in order to use it. However, this is more of a plus than a minus, as it ensures the confidentiality of your contacts, allowing only you to see and manage them. The website features convenient navigation, making it easy for users to move around and find what they need. All main parameters and data are easily accessible and intuitively understandable. The application includes a database of all countries in the world with their respective phone codes, allowing users not only to easily find the country code they need but also the country itself. Additionally, there is filtering and search functionality for both countries (by country name or code) and contacts. Group contact management is also available. Users can edit contacts via a pop-up control window by hovering over the contact and clicking on it. In the editing window, users can change the country code, username, and phone number.",

        "description": "HEALTH_EN is a team exam project of the GoIt school. It was implemented by a team of 10 developers over a period of 2 weeks. The entire project, specifically both the Front-End and Back-End, was built from scratch based on the technical specifications and a Figma design. HEALTH_EN is an 8-page application with responsive design, fully compliant with all modern requirements. This site is designed for those who want to normalize their nutrition, monitor their daily calorie intake needed to maintain their current body mass, or according to the selected mode. This application cannot be used without a personal account. To start, the user will need to go through 5 stages of registration and enter their data such as email, password, username, height, weight, age, the diet mode the user will use, choice of gender, and the user's activity level. All this is necessary to provide the user with as accurate information as possible for calculations. In case the user forgets the password, they can easily change it even before logging in. To do this, they just need to go to the 'Forgot Your Password' page and enter their email. They will receive an email with a temporary password allowing them to log into the system. This temporary password can be easily changed on the 'Settings' page, along with any other data previously entered by the user. Also on the 'Settings' page, the user can change their avatar if desired. With daily use of this application, updating their current weight is a mandatory part. This should be the first action of the user when logging into the system for the first time each day. On the 'Recommended Food' page, there is a list of recommended products, taking into account their caloric content. The 'Dashboard' page represents a summary statistics of weight changes, the amount of water consumed, and food intake over the selected period. On the main page, the user can enter and edit the amount of water consumed per day, as well as see the necessary limits of its consumption. The same applies to food. The user is provided with the opportunity to see the required calories, fats, carbohydrates, and how much they have already consumed and how much is left. Convenient graphs help with this. On the 'Diary' page, the user can see all their food intakes throughout the day and also manage them independently. They can fill them in, edit, or even delete them.",

Issues and errors on the 'Settings' page in handling requests to change user data and change user avatar were resolved. A preview of the new avatar when changing it has been added. Custom animations have been added on the main page. Redirect flaws on pages have been fixed (now when the user reloads the page, they remain on it instead of being redirected to the main page).

        "description": "CV_WebSite is a 6-page web application created as a developer portfolio website. It can serve as both a primary and supplementary tool for your resume. The site is fully responsive and meets all modern requirements for such development, looking equally good on all types of devices. The application was built using the REACT/REDUX library with full imitation of server-side functionality. All data displayed in the application is stored in three JSON files (simulating data retrieval from a backend) and can be easily modified or tailored to another user. In case of a deployed backend or if needed, this application can be easily connected to it, thanks to the pre-configured REDUX state management library. Each page of this site is self-contained and contains all the necessary information about the developer. Upon entering the site, you are greeted with the 'Home' page, featuring the developer's name, a brief description, and the ability to view their resume. The 'About' page contains more detailed information about the developer, including GitHub statistics. This page also features subtle, non-intrusive animation, giving it a livelier appearance. On the 'Education' page, you can find information about the developer's education and the institutions they attended. Animated sliders are present on this page, giving it a more atmospheric look. All photos can be viewed in a separate window by simply clicking on the button on the photo itself. The 'Skills' page contains information about the developer's professional skills, as well as official GitHub statistics for all repositories and programming languages. The 'Portfolio' page is a collection of all the developer's projects. To get information about a particular project, simply hover over the project of interest and open it. This will open a separate window where you can find all the detailed information about the project. The 'Contact' page allows you to contact the developer directly.",

        "description": "CRM V-2.0 is a powerful and multifunctional platform designed to optimize customer relationship management processes. This system provides a complete cycle for processing user and lead data, as well as tools for effective management. Here are the key capabilities and features of CRM V-2.0: (1) User Registration: a) The system allows for external registration of primary users such as 'Developer', 'Administrator', and 'Manager'. The registration process is carried out through strictly defined email addresses and passwords for user validation. b) Internal user registration is performed through users with a higher access level, ensuring control and security of the process. (2) Registration Confirmation: a) After registering a new user, the administrator receives an email notification for confirmation. Without this confirmation, the new user will not be able to log in to the system. (3) Authorization and Session Management: a) The system requires an email and password for authorization, resulting in the creation of a unique access token that includes the user ID, their role, and the database branch. b) Upon logging in, the user receives basic information about themselves, such as name, avatar, role, and branch. (4) Retrieving Current User Data: When the page is reloaded, the system automatically retrieves information about the current user based on the provided token, eliminating the need for re-entering data. (5) Managing Avatar and User Data: a) Users have the option to change their avatar by sending an image file and receiving a link to the new image. b) Users can modify their data, including changing their password, with confirmation of the current password. (6) Managing Offices and Roles: The system provides information about available offices and roles based on the user's access level. Users with a higher access level can view more roles and offices. (7) Working with Leads and Contacts: a) CRM V-2.0 allows users to obtain information about assigned and created leads. Advanced lead management features, including assigning them to specific managers or agents, are available to users with high access levels (e.g., 'Administrators' and 'Managers'). b) The system supports the creation of contacts from external resources and their distribution across offices. (8) Managing Verification and Password Reset: The system allows for resending verification emails and performing password resets, ensuring security and convenience for users. (9) User Deletion: Access to delete users is restricted for users with the highest access level. When a user is deleted, the system automatically clears all bindings to leads and adds comments to the relevant records. (10) Data Analysis and Filtering: Users can filter data by various parameters, allowing them to obtain relevant information based on their access level and roles. CRM V-2.0 is a universal solution for customer relationship management that ensures security, control, and convenience for all user levels. The system offers powerful tools for data management and optimizing business processes, making it an indispensable tool for modern companies.",

        "description": "Calendar is just a small part of the web application development, designed to demonstrate how easily and simply you can implement your daily planner. This application allows you to schedule tasks for each day of the week, organizing them by priority and time. You can input tasks either for the entire day or for a specific time. All these tasks will automatically be displayed on both the monthly and weekly calendars, including full-day events and those scheduled by the hour. It features user-friendly navigation, allowing you to switch between months using the 'Back' and 'Next' buttons and quickly return to the current month via the 'Today' button. You can also quickly switch between views—month, week, or even day—and access a list of all events for the current day. The app includes a convenient form for adding and editing tasks. You can also change the color of your events to signify their priority. The only required fields are the event title and notes. The date and time fields are optional, as the events will adjust based on your preferences and will be displayed accordingly. If no date is entered, the event's date will automatically be set to the one you were viewing when the form was opened. If no time is entered, the event will be considered an all-day event. If you specify the date and time, the event will automatically be assigned to the chosen date and time. Additionally, you can freely move your events across different dates and times. To delete an event, simply open the event for editing and click the 'Discard' button.",

The main goal of the project was to achieve a minimalistic yet bold and eye-catching design with essential functionality for the client: the ability to quickly contact the owner via phone or WhatsApp and place an order. The website is multilingual, targeting Israeli residents who speak not only Hebrew, but also English and Russian. Depending on the selected language, the interface adjusts to the relevant reading direction: left-to-right or right-to-left. An accessibility widget is also integrated into the website, allowing users with disabilities to easily customize the interface to their needs. To bring the site to life and enhance its visual appeal, 3D graphics were implemented as the background, along with a full-screen slider showcasing the available services.",

        "description": "ATLAS is a landing page for a small business in Romania, designed to expand the client base and serve as the owner’s digital business card. The main goal of the project was to create a minimalist, yet vibrant and memorable design with all the necessary functionality: a quick way to contact the owner via phone, WhatsApp, Instagram, or Telegram, and to place an order. The website is multilingual, tailored for Romanian residents who speak not only Romanian, but also English, Russian, and Ukrainian. To make the site more dynamic and visually engaging, 3D graphics were used — allowing users to not just view locations as static 2D images, but to immerse themselves inside the environment and explore the photoshoot location in advance. For convenience, Google Maps was integrated and configured with the studio’s exact geolocation. The website is fully responsive across all screen types, including mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Content and elements dynamically adjust to screen resolution, ensuring a consistent and polished appearance on every device.",

The application is multilingual and supports three main languages: English, Russian, and Ukrainian. Developed using the React library and Vite build tool, the project includes full server-side logic simulation. All displayed data is loaded from a JSON file, making the content easy to adapt for another user. If a backend is available, the app can be easily connected to it. Each section of the website is self-contained and provides all necessary information — from service descriptions and portfolios to contact forms. To add visual dynamism, the project integrates 3D graphics and animations applied to individual elements, blocks, and entire sections.",
