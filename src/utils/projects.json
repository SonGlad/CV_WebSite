To do this, simply enter the image name in the input field and perform the search. When the search based on your query is successfully completed, along with the images, a notification will be displayed indicating how many images were found based on your query. In case nothing is found for your query, a notification will also be displayed. The initial query includes 40 images. If more images are found based on the search, the remaining images can be viewed by clicking the 'Load More' button at the bottom of the screen. For each of your queries, a notification will also be displayed indicating how many images have been viewed and how many are left. All notifications are connected using the 'Notiflix' library. Clicking on any image will open a modal window with an embedded slider, allowing you to view the images in their original size and scroll through them without leaving the window. The modal window and slider are implemented using the 'Simple Lightbox' library.",

A team of master chefs, passionately eager to share their knowledge through exciting culinary masterclasses, decided to create a website-application to provide everyone interested with an impeccable experience, where people can explore the world of delicious recipes and step-by-step video tutorials. This web application is a team project, with a development period of 7 days. TastyTreats is a two-page website-application that contains several sections. They help the user easily and conveniently make a choice and order delicious recipes with step-by-step video guidance on their preparation. On the main page of the website, there is an option to choose the site theme: light or dark colors and a convenient order basket. In the 'ALL CATEGORIES' section, users have the opportunity to choose dishes and ingredients. By selecting specific ingredients, the site will provide the user with dishes that include these ingredients. The 'Gallery' section has a convenient filter and search function, allowing users to find specific dishes, as well as apply filters by cooking time, country of origin, and ingredients. In addition, photos of dishes are provided along with their rating among users. Also, in the 'Gallery' section, there is an option to click on the photo of any dish, which will open a window where a video with instructions for preparing this dish will be available. The necessary ingredients and their proportions, along with a description of the cooking process for the dish, will also be provided. Plus, the cooking time and rating are indicated. After visiting the 'Gallery', choosing a dish, and watching the instructional video, users have the opportunity to write a review of the dish and rate it. And this option is available in a convenient modal window. The 'POPULAR RECIPES' section displays photos, names, and descriptions of the most popular dishes. On the second page, titled 'FAVORITES', users can see the dishes they marked as interesting in the 'Gallery' section. Also, on this page, there is a convenient filter that allows users to find dishes by categories. Plus, if a dish is no longer of interest to the user, it can be easily removed from this section.",

        "description": "Image Finder is a single-page, responsive web application created entirely using the React library. It allows users to easily search for any images using the Pixabay API database. To perform a search, users simply need to enter the image name in the input field and initiate the search. When the search is successfully completed based on the user's query, a notification will be displayed along with the images. In case nothing is found based on the user's query, a notification will also be displayed. The initial query includes 12 images. If more images are found based on the search, the remaining images can be viewed by clicking the 'Load More' button at the bottom of the screen. All notifications are connected using the 'React Toastify' library. When clicking on any image, a modal window will open, allowing users to view the images in their original size. During low internet speeds, users can observe a Loader while waiting, which is connected using the 'React Spinners' library.",

        "description": "Phonebook is a responsive web application consisting of five pages, built using the REACT/REDUX libraries. Initially, it started as an educational project, but thanks to the idea of creating something more than just a learning exercise, it evolved into a fully-fledged, stylized application. Unfortunately, it is only adapted for tablet and desktop devices. The application requires users to be registered in order to use it. However, this is more of a plus than a minus, as it ensures the confidentiality of your contacts, allowing only you to see and manage them. The website features convenient navigation, making it easy for users to move around and find what they need. All main parameters and data are easily accessible and intuitively understandable. The application includes a database of all countries in the world with their respective phone codes, allowing users not only to easily find the country code they need but also the country itself. Additionally, there is filtering and search functionality for both countries (by country name or code) and contacts. Group contact management is also available. Users can edit contacts via a pop-up control window by hovering over the contact and clicking on it. In the editing window, users can change the country code, username, and phone number.",

        "description": "HEALTH_EN is a team exam project of the GoIt school. It was implemented by a team of 10 developers over a period of 2 weeks. The entire project, specifically both the Front-End and Back-End, was built from scratch based on the technical specifications and a Figma design. HEALTH_EN is an 8-page application with responsive design, fully compliant with all modern requirements. This site is designed for those who want to normalize their nutrition, monitor their daily calorie intake needed to maintain their current body mass, or according to the selected mode. This application cannot be used without a personal account. To start, the user will need to go through 5 stages of registration and enter their data such as email, password, username, height, weight, age, the diet mode the user will use, choice of gender, and the user's activity level. All this is necessary to provide the user with as accurate information as possible for calculations. In case the user forgets the password, they can easily change it even before logging in. To do this, they just need to go to the 'Forgot Your Password' page and enter their email. They will receive an email with a temporary password allowing them to log into the system. This temporary password can be easily changed on the 'Settings' page, along with any other data previously entered by the user. Also on the 'Settings' page, the user can change their avatar if desired. With daily use of this application, updating their current weight is a mandatory part. This should be the first action of the user when logging into the system for the first time each day. On the 'Recommended Food' page, there is a list of recommended products, taking into account their caloric content. The 'Dashboard' page represents a summary statistics of weight changes, the amount of water consumed, and food intake over the selected period. On the main page, the user can enter and edit the amount of water consumed per day, as well as see the necessary limits of its consumption. The same applies to food. The user is provided with the opportunity to see the required calories, fats, carbohydrates, and how much they have already consumed and how much is left. Convenient graphs help with this. On the 'Diary' page, the user can see all their food intakes throughout the day and also manage them independently. They can fill them in, edit, or even delete them.",

Issues and errors on the 'Settings' page in handling requests to change user data and change user avatar were resolved. A preview of the new avatar when changing it has been added. Custom animations have been added on the main page. Redirect flaws on pages have been fixed (now when the user reloads the page, they remain on it instead of being redirected to the main page).

        "description": "CV_WebSite is a 6-page web application created as a developer portfolio website. It can serve as both a primary and supplementary tool for your resume. The site is fully responsive and meets all modern requirements for such development, looking equally good on all types of devices. The application was built using the REACT/REDUX library with full imitation of server-side functionality. All data displayed in the application is stored in three JSON files (simulating data retrieval from a backend) and can be easily modified or tailored to another user. In case of a deployed backend or if needed, this application can be easily connected to it, thanks to the pre-configured REDUX state management library. Each page of this site is self-contained and contains all the necessary information about the developer. Upon entering the site, you are greeted with the 'Home' page, featuring the developer's name, a brief description, and the ability to view their resume. The 'About' page contains more detailed information about the developer, including GitHub statistics. This page also features subtle, non-intrusive animation, giving it a livelier appearance. On the 'Education' page, you can find information about the developer's education and the institutions they attended. Animated sliders are present on this page, giving it a more atmospheric look. All photos can be viewed in a separate window by simply clicking on the button on the photo itself. The 'Skills' page contains information about the developer's professional skills, as well as official GitHub statistics for all repositories and programming languages. The 'Portfolio' page is a collection of all the developer's projects. To get information about a particular project, simply hover over the project of interest and open it. This will open a separate window where you can find all the detailed information about the project. The 'Contact' page allows you to contact the developer directly.",
